## About
I am a software engineer with two years of experience on frontend teams: most recently as an Application Architect at Bank of America. I have experience in building single-page applications and frontend modules using web development tools such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Material UI. I graduated Binghamton University with a B.A. in Mathematics and worked two years as an actuarial analyst before transitioning to software development. I love the boundless innovation and possibilities, the joy of learning fascinating technologies, and the excitement of the everchanging landscape of software development. All things that keep me eager for my next adventure.
